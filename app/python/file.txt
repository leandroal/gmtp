Living easy, livin' free
Season ticket, on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride

Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' that Iâ€™d rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round

Hey, Satan!
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey mama! Look at me
I'm on my way to the promise land

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me!

I'm on the highway to hell

I'm on the highway
I'm on the (highway to hell)

I'm on the highway to hell (highway to hell)

Yeah I'm going down anyway
I'm on the highway to hell
